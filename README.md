# Distraction Dash üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ZeTech


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Mohammed Shammas - College Of Engineering Munnar

### Project Description
 Transforms procrastination into an engaging experience. By detecting when users are distracted by social media, it initiates glitches and a playful chase with a virtual character, Jerry the asterisk, prompting users never to distract on their tasks.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever feel like your to-do list is running away from you? In this era the distractions multiplied, and procrastination becomes a daily driver. Distraction Dash transforms this struggle into a thrilling game where you chase away distractions while racing against time. No one on earth ever like to hear the beautiful words coming off of the mouth of their boss or teachers for missing out on their tasks or assignment deadlines,but hooked with the delusional trap of social medias. Will you be able to conquer the chaos or fall into the procrastination?
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Distraction Dash turns your struggle with procrastination into a fun game! When you open any of your social media apps, meet Jerry the asterisk, who pops up to challenge you. You have a 5-second to either catch him or close the app and refocus,Otherwise the app itself wander around the screen.

If you choose to chase Jerry, he scurries around your screen, while funny, distracting messages fill the space. The goal? Catch Jerry to win back your peace(that you never had before with your smart devices) and outsmart distractions(the thing is you'll be bored...sorry there's a typo,you'll be feared to back again to your distractions again) It's a playful way to make staying productive exciting, turning your procrastination into a fun (that you never want to have again like a scary roller coaster ride you're afraid of).The solution I'm proposing is so simple(as simple as making a tea),easy to install(just like having a chococlate desert in the summer),and reliable and storage friendly for your drive(just like an Ikea furniture).It also got an additional feature that comes into action when you become idle for more than 30 seconds in between your work routine.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- AutoHotKey
- AutoHotKey Standard Library

### Implementation
For Software:Distraction Dash is a quirky, interactive desktop experience designed to help users dodge the lure of social media and avoid procrastination traps. By detecting when a social app is opened, it initiates a playful wandering of your social media app window, prompting users to refocus. If ignored, Chaos Mode kicks in, where social apps start "running away" from your clicks, and pop-up messages appear, challenging your resolve to stay focused. Combining gamified elements like a character and randomized prompts, Distraction Dash turns the battle against distraction into a fun, chaotic game that gently nudges you back on track.

### Project Demo

The Video Showcases how simply the system can be activated and how effectively it's working.

# Additional Demos
additional Note: The Program also consist of additional music files that plays when the chaos mode is activated to make things more appealing and much emotional,but due to my laptop's limitations,some soecific functions are not working due to some version compatability issues (and also comes with some animation options).I know,I know...who cares about excuses,but i believe it's my reponsibility to just let you know the thing.
anyway,thank you for the great ooportunity TinkerHub,i got many personal and professional lessons along with some technical knowledges derived from my struggles as a solo developer
